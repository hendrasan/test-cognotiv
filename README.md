# test-cognotiv

A test project built with Vue.js and TailwindCSS.

Some of the challenges are due to the design was in large (and only one) viewport, I have to make some adjustments to make it look good both on mobile and desktop.

Also, the animation proves to be quite a challenge. On real project, I would probably use Javascript animation libraries, but for this project I wanted to test the limit by relying only on CSS and mostly Tailwind.

It's not 1-to-1 compared to the design, but I think it's pretty close.
